A grading tool for student participation on Slack
This repository is a modified version of an original tool created by Dr. Elle O'Brien of the University of Michigan, whose repository can be found here[https://github.com/elleobrien/participation-bot/blob/main/README.md].

Many thanks to Elle for her advice
