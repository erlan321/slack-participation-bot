# slack-participation-bot
A grading tool for student participation on Slack
  
  
This repository is a modified version of an original tool created by Dr. Elle O'Brien of the University of Michigan, whose repository can be found here: https://github.com/elleobrien/participation-bot.  Many thanks to Elle for her help and advice on this project!  

This updated repository was created to give an instructor the ability to measure student participation in a Slack channel for different types of courses in the University of Michigan Masters in Applied Data Science (MADS) program.  
 - Use case #1:  In a project-oriented course, teams of students (or individual students) are expected to post periodic "stand ups" about their project, and then also review and comment/advise their fellow students.
 -  Use case #2:  In a course that requires weekly reading assignments (or similar material), and individual students are expected to post their own thoughts on the reading, and then also review and discuss the thoughts of their fellow students.

__Running the Grading tool:__
Once the repo is copied to your local drive and you have created the required input files, the grading tool can be run from a command prompt:
```
$ python bot.py <channel-name> <from-date> <to-date>
```
For example,
```
$ python bot.py siads999_fa22_course_name 08/22/2022 08/28/2022
```

   - ```{ "token" : "xoxb-123456789123-4567891234567-abc123abc123abc123abc123a‚Äù }```
